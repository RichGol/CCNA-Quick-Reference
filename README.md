# The CCNA Quick Reference Guide

## Purpose

This GitHub repository hosts a personal project to organize CCNA 200-301 material and IEEE 802 protocols for quick reference and study. It is not a replacement for official CCNA learning material and does not include all topics covered by the current CCNA 200-301 exam.

The project is written with the LaTeX markup language, which results in a searchable PDF document when typeset. This repository primarily exists to share the PDF document with those who find it useful, although those who are curious are welcome to explore the underlying LaTeX code.

*Note: The LaTeX code most likely does NOT adhere to best-practices, as I am self-taught in the language and solve issues as they arise. This is not my first LaTeX document, and it will not be my last.*

I created this project shortly after becoming CCNA certified in order to more legibly organize my personal study notes. I am sharing it in the interest of helping others who are pursuing their own interests in networking.

## File Structure

`CCNA_RefDoc.pdf`: The primary file, a searchable PDF that those pursuing CCNA certification or networking may find useful.

`CCNA_RefDoc.tex`: The LaTeX markup language "source code", which can be typeset by a TeX editor to create a searchable PDF.

`images`: A folder containing all images that are typeset by LaTeX into the resulting PDF.
